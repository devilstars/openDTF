## Pet project. Open "DTF.ru / VC.ru / TJournal.ru" like service.

This is **backend only**. Frontend development is here: https://github.com/devilstars/opendtf-front 

OpenDTF is an open source website boilerplate based upon the popular Cmtt service network. It attempts to mimic the original service as closely as possible while extending it with new features. If I have time to do it :)

### Important notes:
05/02/2020 - This repo is going to be Laravel API only. Frontend part will be moved here: https://github.com/devilstars/opendtf-front
