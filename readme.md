Despite the fact that I really like the idea of dividing the front and backend into two projects, it would be optimal to choose a different stack for such a task.
All working code has been moved to a [separate repository](https://github.com/devilstars/opendtf_tall), and this one has been sent to the archive.

## Pet project. Open "DTF.ru / VC.ru / TJournal.ru" like service.

This is **backend only**. Frontend development is here: https://github.com/devilstars/opendtf-front 

OpenDTF is an open source website boilerplate based upon the popular Cmtt service network. It attempts to mimic the original service as closely as possible while extending it with new features. If I have time to do it :)

### Important notes:
05/02/2020 - This repo is going to be Laravel API only. Frontend part will be moved here: https://github.com/devilstars/opendtf-front
